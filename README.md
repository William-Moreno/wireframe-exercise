### Reflections and Comments

- I was a little surprised at how long this took me to complete. Overall, I am satisfied with the results, but I expect there are a number of shorter conventions to achieve the same results as I had here.
- I used placeholder images from Placeholder.com _(link above)_ to help construct the wireframe.
